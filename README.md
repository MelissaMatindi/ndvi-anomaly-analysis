# 🌍 Drought Monitoring Using NDVI Anomalies in Google Earth Engine

This project leverages **Google Earth Engine (GEE)** and **Python** to analyze NDVI anomalies across Ethiopia (2015–2024) to detect drought-prone regions and support Sustainable Development Goals (**SDGs 2, 13, 15**). It was developed as part of the **UNDP-sponsored FTL Cybersecurity Training**, blending **GIS**, **Machine Learning**, and **Cybersecurity** principles.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Monitor drought severity using NDVI anomaly maps and time-series graphs  
- Apply ML (K-Means) for drought classification  
- Ensure data security with OAuth and optional encryption  

---

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- **Python**, **Google Earth Engine**, **geemap**, **matplotlib**, **GDAL**, **GeoPandas**  
- **Landsat 8 Surface Reflectance** data  
- **scikit-learn**, **cryptography**, **Jupyter Notebooks**  

---

## 📈 Outputs
- NDVI anomaly maps (2021–2024)  
- Annual NDVI trend chart  
- ML-classified drought severity map  
- Exported **GeoTIFFs** & analytical report  

---

## 🔐 Security
- OAuth-based GEE access  
- Optional encryption using `cryptography.Fernet` for data protection  

---

## 🤖 Optional ML Implementation
- **K-Means clustering** for anomaly classification (severe, moderate, none)
